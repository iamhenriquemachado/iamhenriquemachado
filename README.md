Hi, I'm Henrique — a backend developer who enjoys solving complex problems (especially those late-night debugging sessions). I work primarily with Python, FastAPI, C#, and .NET.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring how things break — just so I can figure out how to fix them.

## Technical Experience

**Languages:** Python, C#
**Frameworks:** FastAPI, Flask, .NET, Next.js, React
**Tools & Technologies:** Visual Studio Code, Git, Postman, terminals
